# Introduction to the public version

Trail of Bits utilizes GitHub for many of our reviews; we check in client source code, our source code, screenshots, notes, &c. to
a single repository, and co√∂rdinate our efforts through GitHub. For example, we ran our various network scenarios through
the following issues:

- [As an external attacker](https://github.com/trailofbits/audit-kubernetes/issues/39)
- [As an internal attacker](https://github.com/trailofbits/audit-kubernetes/issues/38)
- [As a Malicious Internal User](https://github.com/trailofbits/audit-kubernetes/issues/37)

We have a system for tagging issues with severity, help needed, &c., allowing a single location for the assessment team to  
look for any project related information. Furthermore, we often invite clients to our repositories, allowing them to have 
the same level of insight as we do regarding project status. We decided to open up our repository for this assessment, showcasing
our work, the notes we wrote, and allow the community to see what directions we took during the assessment.

# Highlights of the repository

There are several areas of the repository that may be of interest to the community:

- Bobby's [Vagrant scripts for Kubernetes](https://github.com/trailofbits/audit-kubernetes/tree/vagrant-kubernetes) to help users deploy a local testing environment
- Dominik's [Notes detailing his processes](https://github.com/trailofbits/audit-kubernetes/tree/master/notes/dominik.czarnota) throughout the assessment
- The [Rapid Risk Assessment documents](https://github.com/trailofbits/audit-kubernetes/tree/master/notes/stefan.edwards/rra), detailing our discussions with the wider community
- The [threat modeling templates](https://github.com/trailofbits/audit-kubernetes/tree/master/notes/stefan.edwards/tm), including PyTM usage, data flows, &c. 

Additionally, we have included a new directory, `./reports`, that includes the final versions of each of the three reports we (Trail of Bits) wrote. This includes 
the three main reports we wrote:

- [The technical review](https://github.com/trailofbits/audit-kubernetes/blob/master/reports/Kubernetes%20Security%20Review.pdf)
- [The threat model](https://github.com/trailofbits/audit-kubernetes/blob/master/reports/Kubernetes%20Threat%20Model.pdf)
- [The white paper, detailing our experiences with Kubernetes as a whole](https://github.com/trailofbits/audit-kubernetes/blob/master/reports/Kubernetes%20White%20Paper.pdf)

# Original Overview

This repo is meant to hold:

- the source code for Kubernetes (`./src/`)
- the source code for any tools or notes (`./notes/`)
- any screenshots (`./screenshots/`) 
- and the requisite data created during the assessment (`./data`)

This assessment is going to be **enormous**:

Please:

- keep detailed notes about what you were working on and when, in a logbook format
- add findings *as you find them* and not after

We've added some templates in `./data/templates` to help keep notes & findings in similar format for mass consumption.

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask!

# ICS-style project management

ICS, or [Incident Command System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incident_Command_System) is a system of management for
distributed and fluid teams in times of crisis. It has a few useful points we should adhere to:

- Objective-based management: each team will have a lead, the lead will be responsible for that area.
- Accountability and professionalism: each person will know their project area, and be responsible for maintaining that section of the project
- Unified Command Structure: folks should report to their team leads, team leads to the project leads from ToB & Atredis
- Unified Terminiology: this is key: we **must** use the same terminiology across teams and projects.

For example: we must decide on Kubernetes vs k8s early on, and **only** use that terminiology. All other variants **must** be rewritten to the 
decided upon terms. The sole exception is quotation from other sources that may use a different term.
