# Overview

Stefan Edwards' notes on kubernetes, including pre-gaming notes (K8S Clusters I have known & loved).
The two files here are:

- `go_vet.sh` a hack around Go's terrible package name spacing since `make vet` was broken for me
- `go_vet.log` the results of the initial run of `go vet` across the 2.2k packages in k8s
