# Control Families 

These are the areas of controls that we're interested in based on what the audit working group selected. 

When we say "controls," we mean a logical section of an application or system that handles a security requirement.

For example, an system may have authorization requirements that say:

- users must be registered with a central authority
- all requests must be verified to be owned by the requesting user
- each account must have attributes associated with it to uniquely identify the user

and so on. 

For this assessment, we're looking at six basic control families:

- Networking
- Cryptography
- Secrets Management
- Authentication
- Authorization (Access Control)
- Multi-tenancy Isolation

Obviously we can skip control families as "not applicable" in the event that the component does not require it. For example,
something with the sole purpose of interacting with the local file system may have no meaningful Networking component; this
isn't a weakness, it's simply "not applicable."

For each control family we want to ask:

- What does the component do for this control?
- What sorts of data passes through that control? 
  - for example, a component may have sensitive data (Secrets Management), but that data never leaves the component's storage via Networking
- What can attacker do with access to this component?
- What's the simplest attack against it?
- Are there mitigations that we recommend (i.e. "Always use an interstitial firewall")?
- What happens if the component stops working (via DoS or other means)?
- Have there been similar vulnerabilities in the past? What were the mitigations?
